== Purpose

To describe how to use `giblish` as a tool for creating a static web site backed by a git repo that is automatically generated each time a contributor push changes to the git repo.

This text covers the followwing deployment scenarios:app-name: 

 . Using a git hook together with a simple (well) shell script
 . Using a git hook together with Jenkins.

They have been tested on Linux servers (Ubuntu). Most of the tools and scripts should work on a Windows server as well but might need some tweaking and is, again, not tested.

If you want to dive straight in and setup one of the scenarios below, jump to <<setup_instructions>>, otherwise read on for some examples and considerations.

== Git hook and shell script

This requires the least number of dependencies to work but is more limited.

.Deploy using git hook and shell script
image::deploy_with_hooks.svg[]

The components needed on the server are:

A 'Main Repo'::
The common (bare) git repo used by all content writers to push updates to. This repo shall be setup with a server-side hook (_post-receive_) that initiates the html generation and is triggered by each push to the repo.

A 'Staging Repo'::
A mirror of the _Main Repo_ that fulfills two functions:

 . to provide a checked-out working tree with the source files (adoc files).
 . to provide a script that uses giblish to generate html documents and publish those docs to a location where a web server can access them.

Web Server::
Apache, Ngnix or other web server that provides clients with HTML pages located somewhere on the file system on the server (e.g under /var/www/... )

=== Pros & Cons

Pros::
 * it has few dependencies on external tools, only git, giblish and a web server are needed for this to work.
 * giblish provides templates for the `post-receive` hook.

Cons::
 * The hook and publish scripts provided with giblish runs synchronously at each push from a _Doc Writer_ to the _Main Repo_. The time it takes to generate the HTML docs from the adoc source will thus be added to each push to the _Main Repo_.
 * You need to manually setup the _Staging Repo_ on the server and this is a bit more 'hackish' than letting a build orchestrator tool implement a proper 'build' of your documents. You might for example end up with race conditions if two pushes to the _Main Repo_ are done close in time.

=== Using a combination of Jenkins and git hook

This setup adds a Jenkins (or similar build orchestrator) installation so it is more tools to setup but offer more flexibility and performance. It is also more robust and thus more 'production friendly'.

If you are already doing some kind of development, chances are that you already have this kind of setup as a CI pipeline.

.Deploy using Jenkins
image::deploy_with_jenkins.svg[]

The components needed on the server are:

Main Repo::
The common (bare) git repo used by all content writers to push updates to. This repo needs to be setup with a server-side hook (_post-receive_) that are executed by git after each push to the repository.

Jenkins instance::
A running instance of Jenkins and one or more defined build jobs that use giblish to build the HTML documents.

Web Server::
Apache, Ngnix or other web server that provides clients with HTML pages located somewhere on the file system on the server (e.g under /var/www/... )

==== Pros & cons

Pros::
 * Using Jenkins enables a lot of flexibility and scaleability. You can setup multiple Jenkins agents to increase performance, you can define many build jobs where each job builds either a particular branch from a particular git repo or many branches from one or many repos.

Cons::
 * You need to be familiar with, and maintain, the Jenkins instance.

[[setup_instructions]]
== Setup instructions

Follow the instructions below to get one of the above setups running on your server.

=== Some preliminary notes

IMPORTANT: Setting up permissions and secure your setup from unwanted access is outside the scope of these instructions. You must understand and implement the proper user/groups/rules for your use case.

NOTE: git server side hooks are used in the instructions below. For details on git hooks see https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks[this doc].

[[common_setup]]
=== Initial setup

These steps are common to both deployment scenarios.

giblish setup::
 . Install ruby on the _Server_ (a version no more than 18 months old)
 . Install giblish on the _Server_ using `gem install giblish`

git and gitrepo setup::
 . Install git on the _Server_.
 . Setup the *bare* _Main Repo_ on the _Server_ by either.
 .. Copy a bare repo you already use to the _Server_ file system.
 .. Initiate a new repo using `git init --bare <your_repo_name>` somewhere on the _Server_ file system.
+
NOTE: If you start with an empty, bare, _Main Repo_ on the _Server_, it is a good idea to directly clone it to your local machine, commit some content to the 'master' branch and push the result back to the _Main Repo_. An empty, bare repo does not even contain a 'master' branch from the start and this can lead to some edge cases that complicate things.

=== Use a git hook and shell script

First, follow the steps described in <<common_setup>>. Then proceed with the steps below.

 . Setup the _Staging Repo_ on the _Server_ by cloning the _Main Repo_ to a suitable folder in the _Server_ file system, ex:
+
.Setup a staging repo in your home folder on the _Server_
====
[source, bash]
----
# go to your home directory
cd ~ 

# clone the Main Repo, assuming it is located at /usr/local/main_repo.git
git clone file:///usr/local/main_repo.git
----
====
 . Make a copy of the `post-receive.example` template from the installed `giblish` gem.
+
.Find the `post-receive` template in the giblish gem
====
On a server running Ubuntu 16.04, `gem which giblish` returns:

 /var/lib/gems/2.6.0/gems/giblish-0.7.0/lib/giblish.rb

and the template hook can be found under

 /var/lib/gems/2.6.0/gems/giblish-0.7.0/scripts/hooks/post-receive.example
====

 . Rename the copy to `post-receive`
 . Tweak the configuration variables of the copy to suite your use case.
 . Move your copy to the `hooks` directory of your _Main Repo_.
 . Set the execute permission using `chmod +x post-receive`

That's it. You can now push to your _Main Repo_ and the `post-receive` hook will run `giblish` on the branches that you set it up to.

=== Setup the git hook and Jenkins scenario

TBD...

First, follow the steps described in <<common_setup>>. Then proceed with the steps below.

==== Sequence for generating documents

The following image shows how the sequence from user commit to generated documents.

=== post-update hook

Below is an example of a `post-update` hook that triggers Jenkins jobs after a push to a git repo. This hook should be installed on the server side git repository to trigger Jenkins builds
