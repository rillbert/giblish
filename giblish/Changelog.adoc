== v2.0.0

This is a breaking release because the internal dependencies to asciidoctor-pdf has been bumped from one major release to the next. `giblish` itself has not seen any major, internal, updates.

Breaking changes::
 * Dependency on asciidoctor-pdf has been bumped to v2.3
 * rename some pdf attributes internally in giblish to comply with the new version of asciidoctor-pdf

== v1.0.0

This release includes a complete refactoring of almost the entire code base.

Breaking changes::
 * The '-w' flag is removed
 * The text search parameters interface has changed completely. A written specification of this interface is included in the docs.
 * The '-r' flag will, for html generation, *copy everything* under the given directory to the target location.
 ** the previous restriction on folder names has been removed.
 * The '-s' flag now instructs giblish to use any matching style found under the resource directory given by the '-r' flag. The exact path is no longer necessary.
 * The doc attribute `:icons: font` is now set by default.
 * The source highlighter attributes are now set as follows by default:
 ** :source-highlighter: rouge  :rouge-css: style  :rouge-style: github
 * The format of the index pages has been updated

Changes/New functionality::
 * Rouge is used as source highlighter and the default is to use the following attributes:
 ** :rouge-css: style
 ** :rouge-style: github
 * A --server-css-path flag can be used to set a path to the css file used by generated html documents when served via a web server.
 * A --server-search-path flag can be used to set the URI path to the location of a server-side search script that can supply the user with search results.
 * A --copy-asset-folders flag can be used to copying full directories from the source to the destination tree.
 * Index pages are generated for each subdirectory in the target document tree.
 * The format of the git summary page has been updated and more info included.
 * The text search server-side cgi script has been rewritten.
 * The text search for web-server-served html docs has been updated in the following ways:
 ** the asciidoc 'include' directive is supported by expanding them and include the resulting text in the search database.
 ** the implementation of the server-side search tools are written completely in ruby and does no longer depend on an external 'grep' tool.
 ** almost all needed infrastructure for implementing a server-side search script has been implemented within the 'giblish' gem.
 * The asciidoctor toolchain dependencies are updated to the latest versions (at the time of release).


== v0.8.0

 * *Breaking change* require ruby 2.7
 * update asciidoctor tool deps to latest versions

== v0.7.0

 * *Breaking change* include the entire path in the -i and -j options
 * *Breaking change* change the meaning of the -w flag (and rename the long form to --web-path)
   and add the -mp flag.
   This was done as a means to remove the hard-coded arguments to the search box html so that one
   can generate html docs to a destination that is not the same as the one where they are deployed
   on a web server.
 * take the idprefix and idseparator into account when indexing sections for text search
 * Add the font awesome css as link to search box and use the magnifying glass icon
 * update README file
 * handle the case where a 'index.adoc' file exists by making the basename configurable using the
   '--index-basename' flag.
 * update the dependencies to the latest asciidoctor-pdf release
